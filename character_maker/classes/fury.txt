Furies never know when to quit. In battle and life they are energetic, determined and often restless. Whatever ideals or desires drive their actions,
they will stop at nothing and risk everything in order to achieve them.

Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points by 5.
Gain the ability to equip martial melee weapons and martial armor.

Adrenaline
As long as you are in Crisis, you deal 2 extra damage (be it with attacks, spells, Arcana, items or any other method).

Frenzy
Your Accuracy Checks with brawling, dagger, flail and thrown weapons trigger a critical success if both dice show the same number (and the Check is not a fumble).

Indomitable Spirit
When you spend one or more Fabula Points, you get an additional benefit — choose one option: you recover 5 Hit Points; or you recover 5 Mind Points; or
you recover from a single status effect of your choice.

Provoke
You may use an action and spend 5 Mind Points to perform an Opposed Check against a creature you can see — describe how you taunt them! If you succeed,
the target suffers enraged and is compelled to focus their attention on you (their attacks and offensive spells must include you among the targets if possible). This
compulsion ends if you fall unconscious or leave the scene, if the creature is no longer enraged, or if they are successfully provoked by someone else.

Withstand
When you perform the Guard action, if you choose not to provide cover to another creature, you recover Hit Points equal to 1 x the highest strength
among your Bond and choose Might or Willpower: you treat the chosen Attribute as being one die size higher (up to a maximum of d12) until the end of your next turn.
