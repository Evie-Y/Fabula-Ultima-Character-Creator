# Fabula-Ultima-Character-Creator
My first repository on GitHub. A simple character creator for the TTJRPG *Fabula Ultima.*
  https://github.com/Evie-Y/Fabula-Ultima-Character-Creator 
Explanation Video
## Description
I intend to make a character creator based on the TTJRPG, *Fabula Ultima*. 
It will help with making more RPG media accessible and beginner-friendly.

## Features
- Class
	- Allow user to pick class(es) and have the relevant information pop into
  their inventories.
- Base Stats
	- Explain to the user how stats are disrupted and allow them to choose
  stats accordingly. It would also include other basic functions like equipment.
- Bonds
	- Allow the user to insert names, relationship types, and strengths of the 
  character.

## Challenges
- I will need to be able to better keep track of .txt files and better learn how to 
organize them.
- I will need to enlarge my understanding of UI and modify the screen for an 
appealing look of the window.
- I will need to look up code related to mouse commands, like 'click-and-drag'.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
An aesthetic window with drop downs and guides on how to create a character in 
*Fabula Ultima*. It includes drop downs, such as Class, Stats, Equipment, Skills,
Level and Bonds. It will include clickables, 'click-and-drag' mechanics, and 
a drop-down of the current character.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A window that has the tabs Class, Stats, and Bonds. The different Classes, 
Bonds and Stats are listed.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Input all the *Fabula Ultima* classes into .txt files in the repository.
  2. Create a function where the classes can be called upon and added/updated characters.

- Week 2
  1. Create a .txt file of stat options, which will differ based on the classes picked.
  2. Create a function where the stats/skills/equipment/level can be called upon and 
  added/updated character.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Create a bond.txt, holding the 6 different types of bonds and strength levels. 
  Includes guides.

  will be editable via text box.
