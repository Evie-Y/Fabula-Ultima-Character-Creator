Proud and selfless, Guardians are individuals who know the value of life... and are willing to sacrifice themselves for a person, nation or ideal they

scarred by a thousand battles. While some Guardians may appear loud and boisterous, many are simply masking the tormented memory of those
they failed to protect.
