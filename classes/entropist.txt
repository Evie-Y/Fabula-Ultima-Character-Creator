High above the stars, where their lights do not shine, lies a bottomless void where life and souls wither and transform in unfathomable ways.
This realm is a non-reality, an endless expanse of chaos impervious to the laws of time, space, and probability.
Entropists refer to this realm as the Cosmos, the Heavens, or quite simply as Lady Luck: they are among the few gifted with the ability to channel its
reality-bending energies.

Permanently increase your maximum Mind Points by 5.
You may perform Rituals whose effects fall within the Ritualism discipline.

Absorb Map
After you suffer damage, you may immediately recover 2 Mind Points.

Entropic Magic
Each time you acquire this Skill, learn one Entropist spell.

Lucky Seven
You have a lucky number; at the beginning of each session, that number is 7. Once per
scene after you perform a Check, you may replace the value shown on one of the dice
you rolled with your lucky number (even if this would give an impossible Result, such
as a value of 7 on a d6). If you do, the replaced value becomes your new lucky number.

Ritual Entropism
You may perform Rituals whose effects fall within the Entropism discipline.

Stolen Time
During a conflict, you may use an action to interfere with the flow of time by spending
up to 5 Mind Points. For every 5 Mind Points you spend this way, choose one
option: one creature you can see suffers slow; or one creature you can see recovers
from slow; or one creature you can see may immediately perform the Equipment
action for free; or choose one ally you can see who has yet to take a turn during this
round: that ally may take their turn immediately after yours during this round.
Each option can only be chosen once per use of this Skill.
